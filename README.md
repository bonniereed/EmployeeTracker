# EmployeeTracker

This app will allow an end user to view a workplace and the heirarchy structure. Employee roles, salaries, and IDs will be displayed

# Technologies used:

I used Node.js, mySQL, Inquirer, Console.table, and nodemon.

# Challenges faced:

I had a hard time getting mysql queries to work due to syntax issues. I wound up rewriting my schema several times and finally got things to work.

# Installation:

To use my app you'll need to install mysql, node, npm, npm inquirer, and npm console.table.

# Credits

Credit is due to the dependencies listed above and yours truly!
